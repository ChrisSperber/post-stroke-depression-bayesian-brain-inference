## Reproducing the Analysis

This project was developed and run using Python 3.12.9 in a local `venv` environment.

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ChrisSperber/post-stroke-depression-bayesian-brain-inference
cd post-stroke-depression-bayesian-brain-inference
```
### 2. Set up environment
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```
### 3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 4. Run Analysis

The main analysis scripts are sequentially ordered with alphabetic prefixes. See docstrings for further information.
The code is intended to load large datasets of >2000 images, which was feasible with a 16GB RAM system, but required additional steps for float-precision data at 1mm³ isotropic resolution (see d_bayesian_inference_discmap.py). Systems with less RAM may require further changes to the code to be able to handle the data.

## Details on methods
This repository adapts [Bayesian Lesion Deficit Inference](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36914109/), previously written in R with the [BayesFactor Package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BayesFactor/vignettes/manual.html), to Python.
The original implementation with the BayesFactor package required processing times that grew exponentially with sample size, and were already at 2-3 hours with sample sizes of 300 subjects [(see results section here)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36914109/). As the code was intended to be run on a large dataset on >2000 subjects, Bayes Factors were now computed using an [approximation](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/BF03194105) using the Bayesian Information criteria (BIC) of general linear models, as well as multi-kernel support.
As in the [original publication](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36914109/), voxel-wise Bayes Factors indicating an association of the voxel's imaging data and a target variable (here: depression severity) are computed via general linear models.

### Analysis Outputs
Outputs are created in /BLDI_Outputs and include, for each analysis
- a Bayes Factor map containing the BF<sub>10</sub> BF_full_{modality}_{timestamp}.nii.gz, whereas modality gives the image type (lesion/lesion network mapoing[lnm]/disconnection mapping[sdsm])
- binned Bayes Factor maps for better visualisation of evidence categories BF_{evidence}_{modality}_{timestamp}.nii.gz, whereas evidence can be "no evidence" (noev), "evidence for h1" (h1), or "evidence for h0" (h0). Evidence for h1|h0 is graded into 1 - BF>3|BF<1/3; 2 - BF>10|BF<1/10 ; 3 - BF>30|BF<1/30; 4 - BF>100|BF<1/100
- a .txt file with meta-information on the analysis

### Reusability
Feel free to reuse and adapt the analysis code for similar datasets. Main functions are contained in utils/utils.py. The current code assumes all images to be located in the same reference space (like MNI space) and unified in shape and resolution.
